What is this?
-------------

Our model takes 2012 presidential election results — how Barack Obama did against Mitt Romney — and adjusts them for 2016 demographics in battleground states (along with a few states Donald Trump has said he can win). Obama would win by more. This is what forms our baseline. Adjust the sliders to create 2016 scenarios compared with the 2012 baseline — for two things: margin of victory and turnout.
